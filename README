=== What is it?
It's a Linux hwmon driver for Asus Prime B550-plus motherboard. And it's
a bad driver.
Status: works for me, use at your own risks.

=== How to try it?
There are basically two options:
  - build in-tree:
    - drop the checked out tree in your kernel source tree
      (drivers/hwmon looks a good land-place)
    - append 'source "<checked out dirname>"' to parent's dir Kconfig
      file
    - do your config/build as you used to
  - build out-of-tree:
    - read the fine manual (Documentation/kbuild/modules.rst at time of
      writing), you will probably need some -dev package if using your
      distro's stock kernel.

=== Why is it a bad driver?
Because Asus considers those boards as still belonging to them, even
after you payed for it.
To be more concrete:
  - it's made out of chip documentation of a related model, but not the
    one found on the board (Nuvoton said the installed chip
    documentation in only distributed to manufacturers).
  - it uses ACPI 'private method' to read values, because it looked the
    less bad option, considering chip access serialisation and
    maintenance. Asus refused to document how to do hardware monitoring,
    arguing it's confidential information...
  - last but maybe not least, it's wrote by a Linux device driver n00b.
Practical consequences:
  - there is no atomic read of more than a byte, so expect some
    transient weird values sometimes.
  - i didn't dare to write to chip, so use BIOS to configure it (fan
    settings for instance).

=== Is the initial author related to Asus?
As a customer only, but a looking-for-better-motherboard-manufacturer
customer now.

=== Should I buy this board?
If you intend to use hardware monitoring features, probably not (even if
using a 'supported' OS, as their WMI implementation looks very broken).
